# Navet Docs

Use this page as the map for the documentation set.

## Keep guidance matched to the product

Before writing or reusing product instructions, tutorials, or marketing claims, cross-check the
current implementation and supported provider/deployment behavior. Inspect the running product
or the exact Storybook component when practical. Existing Markdown, screenshots, and plans are
references to verify, not evidence that a feature still behaves as described.

When a discrepancy is found, update the affected current guide and any working tutorial or plan
that repeats it. Record the implementation reference and what was verified. Distinguish a
component preview or preset demo from a complete workflow on a connected installation. Keep
historical changelog entries as historical records.

## Document lifecycle

Every maintained document must have one clear role:

- **Current guidance** describes the product or architecture as it works today and belongs in the
  user, contributor, maintainer, or AI maps below.
- **Open roadmap** describes outcomes that have not shipped. Remove completed items as part of the
  implementation that ships them.
- **Historical record** belongs in changelog entries, issues, pull requests, and Git history—not in
  required reading or beside current architecture guidance.

Delete completed implementation plans after durable behavior has been captured in current guides
or architecture documents. Do not keep an outdated plan merely to explain why current code exists;
Git history and the linked issue retain that context without presenting it as a current interface.

## Repo Map

Search `packages/` and `apps/` first. Do not assume a repo-root `src/` directory.

- `packages/app/src`: app composition, dashboard behavior, runtime wiring, services, tests, and stories
- `packages/core/src`: provider-neutral contracts, IDs, runtime semantics, and feature models
- `packages/ui/src`: target provider-neutral shared UI package boundary
- `packages/provider-homeassistant/src`: Home Assistant adapter behavior
- `packages/provider-homey/src`: Homey adapter behavior
- `packages/provider-openhab/src`: openHAB adapter behavior
- `apps/standalone/src`: standalone runtime entrypoint
- `apps/demo/src`: demo runtime entrypoint
- `apps/website/src`: website runtime entrypoint
- `apps/docs`: public documentation site; its content config explicitly selects publishable Markdown
- `apps/ha-panel`: Home Assistant panel wrapper/build surface
- `apps/storybook`: Storybook host app
- `platform/home-assistant/`: add-on and custom-component release surfaces

Shared UI reality check:

- `@navet/ui` is the target provider-neutral shared UI boundary.
- `packages/app/src/components/*` and `packages/app/src/ui-kit/*` are still current implementation
  and stable import surfaces.
- Docs should distinguish current implementation, stable imports, and target ownership.
