Open **Household** to keep ordinary home work beside the routines that already run your smart
home. **Today** leads with overdue and due work, then remaining work and completed chores. School
homework set on the **Homework** board appears in the same list and is completed the same way; see
[Set homework for the next 10 days](/guide/everyday-control/manage-household-chores/#set-homework-for-the-next-10-days).

Chores use the shared household workspace supplied by your Navet installation. Check
[where chores are available](/guide/chores/#where-chores-are-available) if your runtime reports
that shared storage is unavailable.

## Complete the guided setup

1. Open **Household**.
2. Choose **Set up chores**.
3. In **Profile**, add everyone who will be assigned work. At least one person must have the
   **Manager** role.
4. In **Customize**, choose each person's colour, icon or photo, reminder destination, and optional
   quiet hours. Device notifications use the connected provider's notification service and require
   that provider's app and notification permission on the person's device.
5. In **Chores**, add one or more recurring jobs.
6. In **Rewards**, choose a motivation style. **Off** keeps the experience focused only on work
   and completion.
7. In **Access**, optionally create a management PIN, review the setup, and choose **Finish setup**.

These are lightweight household profiles used for assignment and attribution. Choosing a profile
on a shared screen is not an account sign-in. The optional management PIN protects planning and
recovery actions without turning profiles into user accounts.

## Add another chore

1. Open **Household → Chores**.
2. Choose **Add chore**.
3. In **The chore**, choose a template or add a title, choose a room, and select a suggested
   Lucide icon or enter another icon name. Navet previews the icon. The **More options** section
   below the main fields holds instructions, estimated time, points, and a child-friendly title.
   Enter a chore name before continuing; Navet shows a message beside any field that needs fixing.
4. Leave the colour swatch in the chore preview automatic to use the stable colour assigned from
   the chore ID, or choose a custom colour. Overdue and completed state colours still take priority.
5. Choose **Next** or **Who does it** in the sidebar, then choose who owns the work:
   - **One person** assigns every occurrence to the selected person.
   - **Anyone can do it** creates one shared occurrence.
   - **Everyone does it** creates one occurrence per person.
   - **Rotate between people** moves through the active participant list in order.
6. Choose **Next** or **When it repeats** in the sidebar, then choose how often the chore
   returns and set **Start date** and **Due time**.
   For weekly and every 2, 3, or 4 weeks, the start date sets the first due date and weekday.
   For monthly chores, it sets the day of the month. Add date limits if needed.
7. Use the **More options** section below the schedule for missed-work behavior or reminders
   when needed. You can move between steps without losing your draft. On a small screen, the
   steps appear across the top instead of in a sidebar.
8. Choose **Add chore**.

Navet schedules dates in the chore's local time zone, including daylight-saving changes.

## Work through Today

Use **Using this screen** to choose the person currently completing or approving work. The Today
list shows **Needs attention** first, followed by remaining work. Completed chores stay
visible as smaller cards, without a time tag, and show the points that were earned.

- Choose **Mark done** to complete assigned work.
- Choose **Claim** first when a shared chore requires someone to take ownership.
- Choose **Approve** to finish a chore that requires approval.
- Choose **Send back** when the chore needs to be done again.

Completed work remains in shared activity history. Changes use revision checks, so a screen refreshes
and retries against the newest household list when another screen saves first.

## Read Chores today and rewards

Chores today keeps the daily summary in one row. When work is overdue, it leads with **Needs
attention**, the overdue count, remaining work, and completed chores. Otherwise it shows earned
points, current streak, and completed chores.
Choose **See rewards** to reveal the supporting mission and reward cards below the banner. They stay
hidden from Today until requested, while **Missions** and **Rewards** remain available as separate
management destinations.

Home shows a Chores summary pill when work remains. Rooms with chores show their own summary, and a
pending chore also appears as a room card. An overdue chore changes the relevant summary pill to the
same restrained red alert treatment used by Security.

## What to do next

- Use **Missions** or **Rewards** only when a shared goal helps the household. Core chores work
  without points.
- Open **Progress** for a weekly review and history export.
- Follow [Manage and recover household chores](/guide/everyday-control/manage-household-chores/)
  to pause work, protect management, or create and restore backups.

## Find automations and scripts

Open the **Routines** tab. Provider automations, scenes, and scripts still live here; native chores
do not replace them.
