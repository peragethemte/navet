Use the management views when the household plan changes. Daily completion stays in **Today** so
setup and recovery controls do not compete with work that needs attention.

## Edit, pause, or archive a chore

1. Open **Household → Chores**.
2. Search by name or filter by room, person, schedule, or status.
3. Choose **Edit** on the chore card.
4. Use the sidebar steps **The chore**, **Who does it**, and **When it repeats** to update the
   work, assignment, and schedule. On a small screen, the steps appear across the top. Choose
   **Next** and **Back**, or select a step directly; your edits stay in place as you move between
   them. The **More options** section below each step's main fields holds instructions, points,
   approval, missed-work behavior, or reminders. The card colour can be changed in the chore
   preview.
5. On **When it repeats**, choose **Save changes**.

The card colour is automatic unless someone overrides it. Automatic colours are stable from the
chore ID and are not based on the selected dashboard accent. Overdue red and completed green remain
semantic and cannot be replaced by the custom colour.

Open the card's **More actions** menu, then choose **Pause** to stop creating new occurrences while
keeping the chore and its history. Choose **Archive** when the definition should leave the active
library; archived chores can be restored later. Deleting a chore stops future reminders but
preserves completed history.

## Set homework for the next 10 days

Homework is a single line of text for one person on one day, so it does not need the chore steps.

1. Open **Household → Homework**.
2. Choose the person in the list on the left. On a small screen, choose them in the row across the
   top.
3. Find the day you need. The board always shows today and the next nine days.
4. Choose **Add homework** on that day, type the homework, and press **Enter**. The field stays
   open, so you can add several lines for the same day without leaving the keyboard.
5. Select the text of an entry to change it, or choose the bin icon to remove it.

The person ticks homework off in **Today**, next to their chores. Homework uses a graduation-cap
icon and one colour per person so it is easy to pick out. It stays due for the whole day and turns
overdue after midnight. Anything still unfinished from an earlier day is grouped above today so it
can be finished or removed.

To move homework to another day, remove it and add it again on the right day. Homework you set is
kept for 90 days and then removed automatically.

## Review progress without ranking people

1. Open **Progress**.
2. Choose the last 7 or 30 days.
3. Filter to one person when you need their activity only.
4. Review completed and missed work, the upcoming week, and the workload note.
5. Export CSV or JSON when you need a copy of the filtered history.

An uneven-workload note is a suggestion. Navet does not silently reassign future chores.

## Manage missions and rewards

Open **Missions** or **Rewards** to create and edit supporting goals. Their cards follow the same
chore card geometry, but they do not appear in Today by default. From Today, choose **See rewards**
in Chores today when you want to reveal the current mission and reward cards for that visit.

## Hide household chores

Chores are enabled by default. To hide the feature, open **Settings → Dashboard**, find
**Household chores**, and choose **Off**. Navet removes the Household chores workspace, Home and
room summary pills, and pending chore cards from room dashboards. Your chore definitions and
history stay saved, so choosing **On** later restores the feature with its existing data.

## Protect management changes

Open **Settings** and configure a management PIN when a shared wall screen should allow completion
but not planning changes. The PIN protects people, definitions, motivation, retention, restore, and
reset actions. It is a household-screen boundary, not an account password, and it is not included
in chores backups. To replace it later, open **Household → Settings → Management PIN**, choose
**Change PIN**, and confirm the new 4–8 digit PIN. Navet asks for the current PIN first whenever
management is locked.

## Finish setup after a management PIN error

If **Open Today** reports **Unlock chore management to continue**, the PIN was saved but the
temporary management session was lost before setup finished. The people, chores, and rewards
already entered are still saved.

1. Keep the setup window open. If it was closed, return to **Household**, choose
   **Create your chore list**, and advance to the final review.
2. Choose **Open Today**. Navet opens **Unlock chore management** when the saved PIN is locked.
3. Enter the management PIN created during setup and choose **Unlock**.
4. Navet retries the final setup step automatically and opens **Today** when it succeeds.

If the PIN is rejected, check the digits and wait 30 seconds after five unsuccessful attempts. If
the correct PIN unlocks the dialog but the same prompt immediately returns, update Navet to the
latest add-on version, restart the add-on once, reopen its **Web UI**, and repeat the steps above.
Restarting or updating the add-on does not remove the saved chore workspace in `/data`.

## Restore a backup during first setup

If this is a new Navet installation and you already have a Navet chores backup, you do not need to
repeat the guided setup.

1. Open **Household**.
2. On the welcome screen, choose **Import backup**.
3. Select the saved Navet chores JSON file.
4. Review the confirmation and choose **Import backup**.

Navet validates the backup before replacing the empty workspace. The backup must contain an active
household manager. A completed backup opens the restored household directly; an incomplete backup
returns to the appropriate setup state.

## Download a backup

1. Open **Household → Settings**.
2. Choose **Data and recovery**.
3. Choose **Download backup**.
4. Store the downloaded `navet.chores` file somewhere protected.

## Restore a backup

1. In **Data and recovery**, choose **Import backup**.
2. Select a Navet chores backup, a supported Home Assistant todo export, or a normalized ChoreOps
   export.
3. Choose **Merge** to keep current chores and remap conflicts, or **Replace** to remove the current
   workspace first.
4. Review the confirmation before restoring.

Download a fresh backup before using **Replace** if the current household may be needed later.

## Recover damaged chore data

If Navet cannot read the current workspace, it leaves the saved file unchanged and shows **Chores
need attention**.

1. Choose **Try again** after checking that the installation storage is writable.
2. Choose **Repair chores** when a healthy last-known-good copy is available.
3. Use **Start over** only when neither copy can be recovered and the existing data is no longer
   needed.

Starting over requires explicit confirmation and preserves the damaged primary file for diagnosis
before an empty workspace is created.
